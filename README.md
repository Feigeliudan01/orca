# ORCA

## Genomics Research Container Architecture

ORCA is a platform for bioinformatics analysis. It is suited for those wishing to conduct self-serve analysis using their own existing data. Hundreds of bioinformatics tools from [Homebrew-Science](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science) are installed in the ORCA Docker image using [Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh). 

Configuring ORCA for use on a multi-user system is described for [Hackseq2017](https://github.com/bcgsc/orca/blob/master/docs/hackseq2017.md) and [MICB405](https://github.com/bcgsc/orca/blob/master/docs/micb405.md).

Configurig ORCA for local usage is provided [here](https://github.com/bcgsc/orca/blob/master/docs/user_manual.md).

See [versions.tsv](versions.tsv) for the complete list of installed tools, and see the [ORCA](http://www.bcgsc.ca/services/orca) web site for more information.

The changes in formulae versions from the previous release of ORCA are listed at <https://bcgsc.github.io/orca/>
